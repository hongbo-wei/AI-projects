Logline: From the dazzling heights of Hollywood stardom to the quiet brilliance of invention, a glamorous actress secretly battles the Axis powers with her groundbreaking frequency-hopping technology, forever changing the landscape of wireless communication.

Three-Act Plot Outline:

Act I: The Golden Cage & The Spark of Genius
Hedy Lamarr, a captivating Hollywood star, is at the peak of her acting career, but beneath the veneer of glamour and public adoration, she feels unfulfilled and intellectually stifled. Haunted by her past experiences, particularly her first marriage to an Austrian arms dealer and the rise of Nazism, she yearns to contribute to the Allied war effort. The attack on Pearl Harbor ignites a fierce determination within her. She meets eccentric composer George Antheil, and their unlikely friendship blossoms into a collaborative partnership. Driven by a shared passion for innovation and a desire to defeat the enemy, they begin to conceptualize a "Secret Communication System" to prevent torpedo jamming.

Act II: The Secret War & The Unsung Hero
Hedy and George embark on a clandestine mission to develop their frequency-hopping technology. They face immense challenges, from the technical complexities of their invention to the pervasive skepticism of military officials who dismiss Hedy as merely a beautiful actress. Balancing her demanding film schedule with late-night experiments, Hedy pours her intellect and passion into the project. Despite their breakthroughs and the successful patenting of their invention, the military bureaucracy proves resistant, and the technology is not widely adopted during World War II, leaving Hedy feeling overlooked and her genius unacknowledged.

Act III: Legacy & Recognition
Years later, as the world embraces the digital age, Hedy's groundbreaking work is rediscovered. Her frequency-hopping principles become the foundational technology for modern wireless communication, directly influencing the development of Bluetooth and early versions of Wi-Fi. Now older and living a more private life, Hedy slowly begins to receive the long-overdue recognition for her extraordinary contribution. The film culminates in her being honored for her invention, finally acknowledging her as a visionary inventor whose brilliance transcended her Hollywood fame, leaving an indelible mark on the world and inspiring generations to come.

**Comparable Films & Their Box Office Performance:**

To assess the box office potential, we can look at recent films with similar thematic elements, target audiences, and production scopes:

1.  **_Hidden Figures_ (2016):**
    *   **Genre:** Biographical Drama, Historical, Female-led, STEM, Unsung Heroes.
    *   **Budget:** $25 million
    *   **Worldwide Gross:** $236 million
    *   **Analysis:** This is arguably the most direct and positive comparable. It succeeded by telling an inspiring true story of brilliant women of color who were instrumental in a critical historical event, overcoming societal and institutional barriers. It was a critical darling and an audience favorite, demonstrating strong appeal for stories of overlooked scientific contributions.

    *   **Genre:** Biographical Drama, Historical, WWII, Unsung Genius (male).
    *   **Budget:** $14 million
    *   **Worldwide Gross:** $233 million
    *   **Analysis:** Similar to _Hidden Figures_ in its focus on a brilliant, eccentric individual (Alan Turing) whose intellectual contributions during WWII were crucial but initially unacknowledged. It proves that complex historical narratives centered on intellectual achievement and wartime ingenuity can perform exceptionally well, especially with awards buzz.

3.  **_Oppenheimer_ (2023):**
    *   **Genre:** Biographical Drama, Historical, WWII, Scientific Genius.
    *   **Budget:** $100 million
    *   **Worldwide Gross:** $956 million
    *   **Analysis:** While a much larger-scale production driven by a renowned director (Christopher Nolan), _Oppenheimer_ showcases the immense potential for a well-executed, intellectually stimulating biopic about a historical figure tied to groundbreaking wartime science. It demonstrates a global appetite for such stories when delivered with compelling drama and high production value.

4.  **_Judy_ (2019):**
    *   **Genre:** Biographical Drama, Hollywood Icon, Female-led.
    *   **Budget:** $10 million
    *   **Worldwide Gross:** $44 million
    *   **Analysis:** This film focused on a later period in Judy Garland's life. While it earned an Oscar for its lead, its box office was more modest. It suggests that while films about Hollywood legends can find an audience, they might not always achieve breakout status unless the narrative offers a broader appeal beyond mere celebrity reverence.

5.  **_Spencer_ (2021):**
    *   **Genre:** Biographical Drama, Historical, Female-led, more artistic/niche.
    *   **Budget:** $18 million
    *   **Worldwide Gross:** $27 million
    *   **Analysis:** This film, a critical favorite, had a more art-house approach to a well-known historical figure. Its performance indicates that a film, even with strong critical reviews and a known subject, can be limited if it leans too heavily into niche storytelling or lacks broader commercial hooks.

**Box Office Potential Assessment:**

The Hedy Lamarr biopic presents **strong box office potential**, particularly if positioned correctly and executed with quality.

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Compelling True Story:** The narrative of a glamorous Hollywood star secretly being a brilliant inventor who revolutionized wireless technology is inherently fascinating and has a high "wow" factor. This "hidden history" aspect is a proven draw.
    *   **Dual Appeal:** It can attract audiences interested in classic Hollywood glamour and historical drama, as well as those intrigued by stories of scientific innovation and unsung heroes. This broadens its potential demographic.
    *   **Timely Themes:** The recognition of overlooked contributions, especially from women, and the impact of science on society, resonate strongly with contemporary audiences. The "inventor of Wi-Fi" hook is a powerful marketing tool.
    *   **Awards Season Potential:** A well-crafted biopic with strong performances could garner significant critical acclaim and awards buzz, which historically translates into increased box office revenue (as seen with _Hidden Figures_ and _The Imitation Game_).
    *   **Inspiration and Empowerment:** The story of Hedy Lamarr is inherently inspiring, showcasing intellect, resilience, and a desire to contribute beyond one's perceived role.

*   **Challenges/Risks:**
    *   **Budget Management:** As a period piece spanning different eras and settings (Hollywood, WWII), production costs could be substantial. It would need to find a balance between authentic period detail and fiscal responsibility.
    *   **Marketing Balance:** The marketing campaign would need to effectively balance the "glamour" aspect with the "genius inventor" aspect to avoid being pigeonholed as merely a celebrity biopic or an overly niche scientific drama.
    *   **Audience Education:** While many know Hedy Lamarr, fewer are aware of her inventive contributions. The marketing needs to quickly communicate this unique selling proposition.
    *   **Casting:** The lead role requires an actress who can embody both Hedy's iconic beauty and her profound intellect. A strong lead performance will be crucial for critical and audience engagement.

**Conclusion:**

Given the successful precedents of films like _Hidden Figures_ and _The Imitation Game_, a Hedy Lamarr biopic has the potential to be a significant box office success. Its unique blend of Hollywood glamour, wartime intrigue, and a groundbreaking scientific discovery positions it as a highly marketable and inspiring story. With a well-managed budget, compelling direction, and a strong lead performance, this film could easily achieve a **worldwide gross in the $150-$250 million range**, making it a very profitable and critically acclaimed venture. It taps into a demand for intelligent, uplifting biopics that highlight often-forgotten historical contributions.
Here are some casting ideas for the characters in your PLOT_OUTLINE, focusing on actors who have received critical and/or fan acclaim for similar roles:

### Hedy Lamarr (Protagonist - glamorous Hollywood star and brilliant inventor)

This role requires an actress who can embody both extraordinary beauty and deep intellectual hidden strength, as well as the frustration of being underestimated. She needs to be convincing as both a Hollywood icon and a determined inventor.

*   **Ana de Armas:** Following her acclaimed performance as Marilyn Monroe in *Blonde*, de Armas has proven her ability to portray iconic, glamorous figures who carry significant inner complexity and vulnerability. She can convey both the public persona and the private struggles of a misunderstood genius.
*   **Lily James:** Known for her versatility in period dramas (e.g., *Downton Abbey*, *Rebecca*, *The Dig*) and her transformative role as Pamela Anderson in *Pam & Tommy*. She has demonstrated the capacity to embody real-life figures with both grace and grit, making her a strong candidate for Hedy's dual nature.
*   **Elizabeth Debicki:** Her critically lauded portrayal of Princess Diana in *The Crown* showcased her ability to capture the essence of a globally recognized, elegant, yet deeply intelligent and often frustrated woman. Her presence and dramatic range would perfectly suit Hedy's journey.

### George Antheil (Eccentric composer, Hedy's collaborative partner)

This character needs an actor who can convey intelligence, eccentricity, and a genuine, supportive partnership without overshadowing Hedy.

*   **Paul Dano:** Renowned for his nuanced and often quirky portrayals of intelligent, intense, and complex characters (e.g., *There Will Be Blood*, *Love & Mercy*, *The Fabelmans*). He excels at bringing depth and a unique charisma to unconventional roles, making him ideal for the "eccentric composer."
*   **Jesse Eisenberg:** Widely praised for playing brilliant, fast-talking, and often socially awkward but highly intelligent individuals (e.g., Mark Zuckerberg in *The Social Network*). He could perfectly capture the intellectual spark and quirky collaboration between Hedy and George.

### Military Officials / Bureaucracy (Antagonistic force, skeptical and dismissive)

These roles require actors who can embody authority, traditionalism, and a subtle dismissiveness, representing the systemic resistance Hedy and George face.

*   **Charles Dance:** Consistently receives acclaim for playing authoritative, often formidable, and sometimes dismissive figures (e.g., Tywin Lannister in *Game of Thrones*, roles in *The Imitation Game*). He can perfectly convey the "old guard" mentality and bureaucratic resistance.
*   **David Strathairn:** Known for his powerful, understated portrayals of intelligent, composed authority figures, often with a subtle layer of skepticism or moral fortitude (e.g., Edward R. Murrow in *Good Night, and Good Luck*). He could effectively embody the initial, polite but firm rejection of their invention.
