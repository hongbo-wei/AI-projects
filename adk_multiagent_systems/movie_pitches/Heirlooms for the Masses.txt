Logline: A visionary designer battles skepticism and convention to transform everyday objects into timeless works of art, proving that beauty and lasting value can be found in the hands of the masses.

Three-Act Plot Outline:

Act 1: The Visionary's Spark
- Introduce Walter Dorwin Teague as a talented but struggling artist/illustrator in the early 20th century, feeling unfulfilled by the ephemeral nature of his work. He yearns to create something more impactful and lasting.
- He observes the burgeoning industrial age and the mass production of functional but often aesthetically unappealing goods, seeing a missed opportunity for beauty and connection.
- A pivotal moment: Teague conceives the radical idea of applying artistic principles to industrial products, believing that mass-produced items can possess inherent beauty and lasting value, becoming "heirlooms" for ordinary people.
- Initial rejections and skepticism from conservative manufacturers who view design as an unnecessary cost or frivolous decoration, not a core component of product development.
- He lands a small, challenging project (e.g., a simple household appliance or packaging) where he proves the commercial viability and consumer appeal of good design, gaining a small but crucial foothold in the industrial world.

Act 2: Forging a New Profession
- Teague's reputation slowly grows, attracting more ambitious and complex projects. He takes on the challenge of designing the iconic Eastman Kodak Bantam Special camera, a project that becomes a testament to his principles of "visible rightness" – where form and function are perfectly integrated.
- He faces significant opposition from traditionalists in both manufacturing and the art world who struggle to understand or value his nascent field. This could manifest as a rival designer who prioritizes pure, unadorned function, or a powerful business magnate who only cares about ruthless cost-cutting.
- The struggle to establish industrial design as a legitimate and respected profession, not just a decorative afterthought. Teague passionately champions the idea that good design can elevate the human experience, foster emotional connections with products, and improve daily life for millions.
- The monumental task of designing the Ford Building for the 1939-40 New York World's Fair. This project pushes his creative and logistical limits, becoming a grand public demonstration of his philosophy and the power of industrial design on a massive scale.
- Personal sacrifices and challenges arise as he dedicates himself to his pioneering work, balancing his artistic vision with the demands of industry and the skepticism of his peers.

Act 3: The Legacy of Rightness
- The World's Fair exhibit is a resounding success, solidifying Teague's reputation and bringing industrial design into the public consciousness as a vital and innovative field.
- He faces a final, significant challenge – perhaps a major economic downturn, the onset of war, or a shift in public taste that threatens the very principles of thoughtful design he championed. He must adapt and prove the enduring relevance and necessity of his philosophy in changing times.
- Teague mentors a new generation of aspiring industrial designers, passing on his vision of "visible rightness" and the importance of creating lasting value and beauty in mass-produced goods.
- The film culminates with a reflection on his enduring legacy: how his work transformed everyday objects from mere utilities into items of beauty and meaning, truly creating "heirlooms for the masses."
- A final scene shows contemporary individuals interacting with his timeless designs (or designs influenced by his principles), highlighting the quiet, pervasive, and positive impact of his work on their lives, demonstrating that good design truly lasts.
