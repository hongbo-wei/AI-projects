Hello, this is Bruce.
I'm testing our speech to text program.
Let's see how well the Whisper can automatically generate the transcription. 
Firstly, we record the latency time between capturing audio and displaying transcription.
Secondly, we compare the input text with the transcription to see the word error rate.
Testing completed.
